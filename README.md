<p>1. A high-level description of your workflow process.<br>
      - Firstly I figured out what kind of WebGL library i would use. I decided upon Three JS
      for its large size and ease of use. I originally just started out with an animated cube 
      spinning in the scene, to get the feel of how three js works. First major element that I
      added into the scene was the water, all that it involves is a plane buffer mesh and a normals
      map to give the illusion of bumpiness and movement in the water. Setting up the lighting and 
      camera was very easy using Three JS. I then downloaded a battleship model from sketchfab
      to use in my scene (as per the specification requiring it) and used the GLTF loader script 
      to bring it into the scene. The final major elements were the lensflare and the skybox. The 
      lensflare was a very simple object that used images to create a lens flare and move as the camera
      moves and the skybox is a cube mesh specifically for creating a skybox. <br>

    2. A discussion of how you interpreted the specification (comment on each section if necessary).<br>
      - I interpreted the specification requiring a realistic boat simulator available via WebGL to 
      create it. Despite my site not including all the features required it was probably an unrealistic 
      expectation to have the entire website and all its features incorporated given the time frame and 
      the time it takes to make a Three JS website. <br>


    3. An evaluation of how you have worked and what you have produced (approx. 150 words).<br>

      - I think I have worked well throughout the task trying my best to produce a WebGL website 
      considering I had never used it before to create websites. I believe that my website is a commendable
      site in terms of production time and an attempt to meet all the requirements of the website specifications.<br>
